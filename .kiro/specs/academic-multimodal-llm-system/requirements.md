# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Academic Multimodal LLM Experiment System designed for research and experimentation with AI-powered image and video generation on a single high-spec gaming rig. The system focuses on learning, experimentation, and proof-of-concept development rather than production deployment, with strong emphasis on copyright compliance and research ethics.

2. WHEN the output type is determined THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate prompts for the specialized models
3. WHEN multiple generation steps are required THEN the system SHALL coordinate multi-step generation workflows
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and memory
5. IF the system is running on limited VRAM (4GB) THEN the system SHALL use CPU offloading for LLM tasks

### Requirement 2: Image Generation Pipeline

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to generate high-quality images from text prompts with various style controls, so that I can experiment with different artistic approaches and fine-tuning strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests image generation THEN the system SHALL support multiple base models (SDXL-Turbo, SD 1.5, FLUX.1-schnell)
2. WHEN generating images THEN the system SHALL optimize for available VRAM (4GB to 24GB+ configurations)
3. WHEN style-specific generation is needed THEN the system SHALL support LoRA adapters
4. WHEN subject-specific training is required THEN the system SHALL support DreamBooth integration
5. WHEN pose or composition control is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate ControlNet functionality
6. IF running on 4GB VRAM THEN the system SHALL enable attention slicing and sequential CPU offload
7. WHEN generating images THEN the system SHALL produce 512x512 images in 30-60 seconds on GTX 1650

### Requirement 3: Video Generation Pipeline

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to generate short video clips from text prompts or images, so that I can explore temporal consistency and motion-specific training approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests video generation THEN the system SHALL support multiple models (Stable Video Diffusion, AnimateDiff, I2VGen-XL)
2. WHEN generating videos THEN the system SHALL optimize for single GPU configurations
3. WHEN temporal consistency is important THEN the system SHALL support temporal consistency training
4. WHEN motion-specific content is needed THEN the system SHALL support motion-specific LoRA adapters
5. IF running on limited VRAM THEN the system SHALL use hybrid CPU/GPU processing
6. WHEN generating videos THEN the system SHALL produce 4-second clips in 5-15 minutes on GTX 1650

### Requirement 4: Copyright-Aware Data Collection System

**User Story:** As an academic researcher, I want to collect and organize training data with clear copyright classification, so that I can ensure ethical compliance and transparent research practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN crawling content THEN the system SHALL classify content into license categories (Public Domain, Creative Commons, Fair Use Research, Copyrighted, Unknown)
2. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL maintain source attribution for all collected data
3. WHEN organizing datasets THEN the system SHALL create separate collections based on copyright status
4. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL allow selective training based on license preferences
5. WHEN using copyrighted material THEN the system SHALL clearly label it for research comparison only
6. WHEN documenting research THEN the system SHALL maintain clear provenance for academic integrity

### Requirement 5: Local Development and Training Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a complete local development environment that can handle model training and inference, so that I can experiment without relying on cloud services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN it SHALL provide local model serving through Ollama and ComfyUI
2. WHEN developing interfaces THEN the system SHALL support Gradio for rapid prototyping
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use SQLite for local data storage and local file system for media
4. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL support PyTorch with Weights & Biases tracking
5. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL implement gradient checkpointing and mixed precision training
6. IF VRAM is limited THEN the system SHALL support model switching with 30-60 second transitions

### Requirement 6: Research-Focused User Interface

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want an intuitive interface that allows me to control copyright compliance and experiment with different models, so that I can conduct ethical research efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating content THEN the interface SHALL provide copyright compliance mode selection
2. WHEN selecting training data THEN the interface SHALL offer "Open Source Only", "Research Safe", and "Full Dataset" options
3. WHEN generating content THEN the interface SHALL display data attribution information
4. WHEN analyzing results THEN the interface SHALL provide dataset license breakdown statistics
5. WHEN documenting research THEN the interface SHALL include fair use justification explanations
6. WHEN saving work THEN the interface SHALL support experiment saving with research notes

### Requirement 7: Phased Development and Experimentation Framework

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a structured development approach that allows incremental learning and experimentation, so that I can systematically explore multimodal AI capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting development THEN the system SHALL support basic text-to-image generation setup
2. WHEN progressing through phases THEN the system SHALL incrementally add video generation capabilities
3. WHEN collecting data THEN the system SHALL start with small, curated datasets (500-1000 items)
4. WHEN fine-tuning THEN the system SHALL support LoRA training pipeline with comparison studies
5. WHEN integrating components THEN the system SHALL connect LLM routing to generation pipelines
6. WHEN completing research THEN the system SHALL support analysis and documentation of experimental results

### Requirement 8: Hardware Optimization and Performance Management

**User Story:** As a researcher with limited hardware resources, I want the system to automatically optimize for my available VRAM and processing power, so that I can run experiments effectively on consumer hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting hardware THEN the system SHALL automatically configure for available VRAM (4GB to 24GB+)
2. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL implement attention slicing, CPU offloading, and cache clearing
